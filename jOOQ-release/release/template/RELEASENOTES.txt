Version 1.7.0 - November 25, 2011
=================================================================
This is a maintenance release for the 1.x branch. Some important
bug fixes are merged from version 2.0. These include:

Bug fixes
---------
#925 - SelectConditionStep should extend SelectConnectByStep, not
       SelectGroupByStep
#926 - AbstractRecord.into() fails to convert java.sql.Date into
       java.util.Date
#937 - In the event of name clash (same name for table and field)
       generated code has errors
#945 - Calling UpdatableRecord.setValue() twice with the same
       argument causes the changed flag to be reset to false
#948 - Always set the changed flag to true in Record.setValue()
#951 - Empty Password for jooq-codegen-maven causes NPE

Version 1.6.9 - November 7, 2011
=================================================================
This is a maintenance release for the 1.x branch. Developments
on this branch will stop after version 1.6.9. Only important bug
fixes are merged to this branch. Developments for release 2.0
have started.

The most important functionality in release 1.6.9 is the newly
added support for JDBC batch operations. You can now batch 
execute several queries.

See the official blog for more information:
http://lukaseder.wordpress.com/2011/10/25/jdbc-batch-operations-with-jooq/

Features and improvements
-------------------------
#621 - Add support for JDBC batch operations
#794 - Add support for ORDER BY [int value] in order to reference
       a column index for sorting
#882 - Optimise Field.isTrue() and isFalse(). Take Field's data
       type into consideration.
#885 - Add support for INSERT INTO .. VALUES (..) syntax, 
       omitting explicit field declarations
#887 - Add <E> List<E> Cursor.fetchInto(Class<E>)

Bug fixes
---------
#748 - H2 regression in 1.3.158 regarding stored functions, which
       return a ResultSet (this was fixed in H2)
#859 - Derby casting of numeric types to BOOLEAN doesn't work
#886 - Regression in date extract function when used in a 
       subselect
#888 - Derby casting of VARCHAR to FLOAT (and similar) doesn't
       work

Version 1.6.8 - October 22, 2011
=================================================================
The main improvement of this release is the re-design of the
stored procedure / function API. With 12 supported RDBMS, which
all have their own idea about what is a stored procedure and what
is a stored function, it has proven to be a better design, to
unite them in one single type: org.jooq.Routine. A routine can
have a return value as well as OUT parameters. It can be embedded
in SQL and used as a field or a table.

This means, you will need to re-generate your database schema,
when upgrading to jOOQ 1.6.8. After re-generation, you'll need to
fix your client code. These are the package changes:

- [generated.package].procedures > [generated.package].routines
- [generated.package].functions  > [generated.package].routines
- [generated.package].Procedures > [generated.package].Routines
- [generated.package].Functions  > [generated.package].Routines

Oracle generated packages are not re-located. With these
improvements, using stored procedures and functions becomes even
more reliable, especially when cursor types are involved. Read
more about the rationale behind this change:

http://lukaseder.wordpress.com/2011/10/17/what-are-procedures-and-functions-after-all/

Apart from that, important improvements have been made in the
area of plain SQL tables. Also, consider a demo integration of
jOOQ with Google Cloud SQL:

Version 1.6.7 - September 25, 2011
=================================================================

This release coincides with the launch of the new website at
http://www.jooq.org. Hence, it ships with little additions to the
deliverable itself.

Apart from new convenience methods, the main addition is a Maven
plugin for jooq-codegen contributed by Sander Plas.

Features and improvements
-------------------------
#797 - Create Maven plugin for source code generation
#825 - Add List<Result<Record>> Factory.fetchMany(String) to
       allow for fetching several result sets from stored 
       procedures, such as Sybase ASE's "sp_help"
#838 - Implement MetaDataFieldProvider.toString()
#841 - Add <T> List<T> Result.getValues(Field<?>, Class<T>)
#842 - Add Query.getBindValues() method to allow for extracting
       bind values in the correct order
#843 - Add Factory.fetch(ResultSet) to transform a JDBC ResultSet
       into a jOOQ Result

API changes (backwards-compatible)
----------------------------------
#837 - Avoid final keyword on Object methods, such as .equals(),
       .hashCode(), etc

Bug fixes
---------
#836 - Bad syntax when selecting from aliased plain SQL tables
#839 - Boolean conversion in getValueAsBoolean() should trim 
       String values first
#840 - Numeric conversions in getValueAsXXX() should trim String
       values first
#844 - NullPointerException when selecting a column from a Result,
       that does not exist

Version 1.6.6 - September 11, 2011
=================================================================

Finally, support for another RDBMS has been added. Sybase's other
important product Sybase Adaptive Server Enterprise (or simply
Sybase ASE) is now officially supported by jOOQ

Apart from this, there had been important improvements with the
recently added INSERT .. RETURNING clause, as well as some fixes
related to DECIMAL / NUMERIC data types

Features and improvements
-------------------------
#796 - Complete missing public org.jooq.impl Javadoc
#800 - Add support for Sybase Adaptive Server Enterprise
#808 - Add support for INSERT .. RETURNING for Ingres
#809 - Add support for INSERT .. RETURNING for Sybase SQL
       Anywhere using SELECT @@identity

#820 - Add Factory.fetchOne(String) for executing plain SQL
       queries that return single records
#826 - Allow for returning several records in the INSERT ..
       RETURNING clause. This now works for DB2, HSQLDB, MySQL, 
       and Postgres
#827 - Support Sybase SQL Anywhere's TOP n START AT m clause
       instead of simulating it with nested SELECT's
       
API changes (previous API now deprecated)
-----------------------------------------
#817 - Deprecate Factory.lastID(Identity)

Bug fixes
---------
#815 - SQL Server fetching of IDENTITY value is broken
#821 - Optimise ResultQuery.fetchAny() executing fetchLazy()
       internally, and only fetching one record from the cursor
#822 - Let Constant cast to more precise NUMERIC/DECIMAL types
       in those RDBMS where casting is necessary
#823 - Cannot bind SQLite BigDecimal, BigInteger types - bind
       them as String instead
#824 - BigInteger values cannot be bound in DB2, Derby
#828 - Document inefficient implementation for GREATEST and LEAST
       in some RDBMS

Version 1.6.5 - August 28, 2011
=================================================================

This release finally adds a loader for CSV data to jOOQ. You can
now load CSV data using a simple fluent API, configuring error
handling, duplicate behaviour and transaction handling, as well
as various CSV parameters.

This release also changes the way generated keys are retrieved
after INSERT's. Instead of (potentially inconsistently) running
SELECT MAX(pk) immediately after the INSERT, Postgres' INSERT..
RETURNING clause is used (or simulated), in a single statement.

Features and improvements
-------------------------
#784 - Add Result.exportXML() to retrieve a DOM document similar
       to that of .formatXML()
#792 - Add support for loading of CSV data into tables
#795 - Add <T> List<T> fetch(int, Class<T>) and 
       fetch(String, Class<T>) convenience methods
#803 - Add support for INSERT .. RETURNING or simulate it where
       not available
#805 - Add <T> T[] fetchArray(int, Class<T>) and 
       fetchArray(String, Class<T>) convenience methods
#806 - Add <T> T fetchOne(int, Class<T>) and 
       fetchOne(String, Class<T>) convenience methods

Bug fixes
---------
#798 - Oracle IN (...) clause with more than 1000 arguments does
       not work
#802 - Use "INSERT .. RETURNING" instead of "SELECT MAX(pk)"
       to retrieve the primary key of a new record

Version 1.6.4 - August 07, 2011
=================================================================

This release ships with a couple of useful concepts inspired by
other frameworks. These are:

- selecting into custom POJO's. Results can be mapped to POJO's
  by convention or using JPA @Column annotations
- selecting into custom callbacks. This is already a wide-spread
  practice in Spring JdbcTemplates.
- selecting long-running queries asynchronously. This idea has
  been inspired by the Avaje Ebean framework

Apart from these changes and some bugfixes, the internal API has
been completely re-designed. The idea here is that query
rendering and variable binding are even faster (less String
objects), more extensible and more accurate. This is a pre-
requisite for many future developments with even more complex SQL
statements, such as for instance CTE's (Common Table Expressions)

Features and improvements
-------------------------
#137 - Add support for asynchronous query execution using
       FutureResult<R> ResultQuery.fetchLater() similar to 
       Avaje Ebean
#198 - Add SELECT INTO functionality into POJO's using 
       <T> T ResultQuery.fetchInto(Class<T>) similar to JPA
       CriteriaQuery
#728 - Add .fetchInto(RecordHandler<R>) to ResultQuery, Result,
       and Cursor to allow for callbacks similar to Spring's
       JdbcTemplate/Ollin Framework
#774 - Add more TRACE logging to .fetchLazy()
#777 - CURSOR: Add function alias: UNNEST for TABLE
#781 - Add E function (Euler number)
#782 - Add <T> T Record.getValue(..., Class<? extends T>) methods
       for convenient type conversion
#785 - Allow for storing TableRecord with a provided Field<?>[]
       indicating the primary key
#786 - Document thread-safety facts in Factory Javadoc
#788 - Add Key.getFieldsArray() convenience method
#793 - Add support for Oracle's SYS_CONNECT_BY_PATH function

API changes (backwards-incompatible)
------------------------------------
#758 - Change internal QueryPart rendering and binding API to use
       Configuration and Context as callback parameters. If you
       use CustomField or CustomCondition, please correct your
       implementations accordingly. Other parts of the API should
       not be affected
#778 - Purge deprecated API, deprecation prior to jOOQ 1.5.7
#790 - Purge deprecated generated code, deprecation prior to
       jOOQ 1.5.7

API changes (previous API now deprecated)
-----------------------------------------
#776 - Deprecate QueryPart.getSQL(), add Query.getSQL()
#789 - Deprecate Record constructors with Configuration
       parameter

Test cases
----------
#636 - Add integration tests for more advanced CONNECT BY
       example
#772 - Add integration tests for selecting cartesian products
       (several tables in FROM clause)

Bug fixes
---------
#730 - Sybase cannot bind null values in plain SQL
#759 - Omit the TOP 100 PERCENT clause in SQL Server ordered
       top-level queries
#767 - An empty Java package is generated for PL/SQL packages 
       containing underscores
#771 - Some exotic literals are not properly escaped with quotes
       yet, e.g. UDT identifiers, VARRAY types, etc.
#775 - Automatic re-attaching after deserialisation does not work
       when used with .fetchLazy()
#787 - The UpdatableRecord's internal changed flags are not
       updated after INSERTs / UPDATEs

Version 1.6.3 - July 31, 2011
=================================================================

This is mainly a maintenance release with lots of bugfixes,
mostly around code generation, plain SQL tables, and data types.
Please note that generated source code may contain incompatible
changes due to #639 (see below for details)! 

Apart from that, project CURSOR is advancing and it is now
possible to unnest arrays into tables. See this article for
details about where jOOQ is heading with project CURSOR:

       to Byte/Short/Integer/Long/BigInteger instead of
       BigDecimal in generated source code. Re-generated code
       will not be compatible!

       newline characters
#743 - Make SQL Server INFORMATION_SCHEMA independent from
       HSQLDB again, to prevent incompatibility issues
#744 - Ingres REAL and FLOAT4 types are generated as FLOAT/FLOAT8
       which maps to java.lang.Double, instead of java.lang.Float
#753 - Postgres error when binding array that contains null
       values
#755 - NullPointerException when converting an array containing
       a null value
#766 - Bad decoding of JDBC Types BIGINT (to BigInteger instead
       of Long) and REAL (to BigDecimal instead of Float) when

Version 1.6.2 - July 10, 2011
=================================================================

This release mainly introduces three new projects.

Project CURSOR where jOOQ finally supports various RDBMS's TABLE,
CURSOR, and REF CURSOR data types. This is especially useful when
those types are returned from stored procedures and functions. 
Cursors are simply mapped to jOOQ Result<Record> types and can 
thus be used like regular table results

Project EXPORT aims at exporting data from the database in 
various serialisable formats, such as XML, CSV, HTML, Text, JSON.
This project will be continued in the future, to also 
deserialise from (some of) these data streams. This will allow 
for easy transport of jOOQ Result<?> types over the net.

Project CODEGEN has finally been started. Many improvements 
suggested by jOOQ users will be implemented in the next releases.
In this release, important fixes have been made to prevent 
compilation errors in generated artefacts.

Version 1.6.1 - June 19, 2011
=================================================================

In this release, the PORTABILITY project has been implemented.
Finally, the SQLDialect has been removed from most generated
artefacts (Schema, Table, Field, Sequence, etc). Also, the
constructing Factory is not referenced by its created QueryParts
anymore, unless this is really necessary (Query objects, UDT's, 
ARRAY types). This leads to higher compatibility between schemata
of different databases, e.g. if users want to use an HSQLDB 
development and Oracle productive database.

Unfortunately, this means that the way stored procedures are
called had to be changed. This is an API break that could not be
avoided. The pre-1.6.1 StoredObject.execute(Connection) method
is deprecated and will be removed in the future. It has been

Version 1.5.8 - April 29, 2011
=================================================================

Finally, jOOQ now supports two important new RDBMS:
SQL Server and Sybase!

Apart from this great enhancement, there is now also full support
for the non-SQL standard LIMIT clause, even in dialects where the
LIMIT clause is not supported natively (especially Oracle, but
also DB2, SQL Server and Sybase, which have limitations). jOOQ
simulates LIMITs by rendering nested selects filtering on ROWNUM
(Oracle) or on ROW_NUMBER() (DB2, SQL Server and Sybase).

Other interesting additions are an increasing support for native
mathematical functions. More function support will be added in
future versions.

Features
--------
#16  - Added support for SQL Server
#21  - Uniform implementation of the LIMIT clause. Implemented
       LIMIT clause simulation through analytic functions, where
       LIMIT is not supported natively

#439 - Added support for mathematical functions (logarithms,
       exponentials, sqrt)
#447 - Enhanced Field.add() and Field.subtract() to work for date
       time fields, also


API changes
-----------
#428 - Created new Maven artefact jooq-meta to cleanly separate
       database meta-data navigation from code generation
#458 - Decreased DSL verbosity for arithmetic operations and for
       ordering

Bug fixes
---------

       in source code generation
#419 - Corrected misleading Select.fetchOne(...) Javadoc
#421 - Optimised AbstractRecord's memory consumption
#448 - Corrected some Javadoc @see links
#449 - Changed Field.concatenate() to accept Field<?> parameters
       to avoid generic varargs warnings

Version 1.5.7 - April 17, 2011
=================================================================

This is the first release built with support of Maven thanks to
the help of some jOOQ users!

The main new features in this release are the improved support
for serialisation/deserialisation of jOOQ objects through use of
the newly introduced "Attachable" interface.

If using log4j or the newly supported slf4j logging framework
in debug/trace mode, there is the possibility to log query
building/execution time statistics.

Apart from these new features, fixes were mainly done in the
fields of type casting, HSQLDB 2.1 upgrade support, stored
procedures with OUT, IN/OUT parameters. Please upgrade, if you
are using any of those features.

If you extend jOOQ as a base implementation for source code
generation, be aware of the fact, that the jOOQ-codegen is
currently undergoing major changes. Expect the code generation
API to stabilise again in one of the next releases. 

Features
--------
#104 - Added maven dependency
#248 - Integrate UDT types with ARRAYs
#295 - Allow for attaching/detaching UpdatableRecords to/from
       Configurations

Version 1.5.6 - March 31, 2011
=================================================================

This release consists mainly of code generation bug fixes and
minor API improvements and enhancements.

The most important improvement is ticket #90, by which lazy
fetching and iteration over data is now supported. jOOQ lets you
keep a reference to a Cursor that has an open JDBC ResultSet, to
fetch data from on-the-fly.

A few major code generation bugs were reported where the
generated code may cause ambiguity due to an inconsistent API.
This means that you will have to re-generate your schema after
upgrading to version 1.5.6. Some of your code may not compile
anymore, after this upgrade.

Features
--------
#90  - Added possibility for lazy fetching of data
#208 - Added convenience methods for direct invocation of
       sequences' currval() and nextval() attributes
#212 - Created one factory per dialect for better separation of
       dialect-specific support
#213 - Generate a factory for each schema
#251 - Opened up base implementations for Field<?> and Condition
       to allow for custom implementations by client code

       may lead to compile-time ambiguities (with javac)
#343 - Add more foreign key navigation method integration tests
#347 - Add explicit integration tests for schema artefacts
       excluded from code generation

code generation. Only the Derby dialect is affected. Please
update immediately, if you are using jOOQ's Derby integration

Bugfixes
--------
#315 - Generated master data records are not sorted by PK
#316 - Derby code generation fatally broken

Version 1.5.5 - March 12, 2011
=================================================================

This version is released early as there are some important
bugfixes. Additional improvemetns include:

- Improved DSL related to conditions in HAVING and JOIN clauses
- Support for Oracle-style functions, such as NVL, NVL2, COALESCE
  DECODE, etc

--------
#304 - Add support for Oracle NVL function
#305 - Add support for COALESCE function

Version 1.5.4 - March 04, 2011
=================================================================

Feature #243 required a minor API change in the base classes of
generated source code. This means you have to re-generate all
your jOOQ artifacts in order to migrate to 1.5.4. The artifacts
themselves should be regenerated in a compatible way, such that
your client code should not be affected. If this is not the case,
please report a ticket here:

  https://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/jooq/newticket

Apart from the Derby RDMBS and some new data type support, there
have been many new convenience methods added all over the API.
For instance, if type-safety is not really a requirement, there
are lots of possibilities to use plain SQL directly in the DSL.
In that case, data can be accessed from Record, Results, not only
through Field<?>, but also through field names or indexes.

Check out the updated documentation (soon) here:

  https://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/jooq/wiki/Examples

- Support for the Derby RDBMS
- Support for casting. This allows for even greater flexibility
  in cases where jOOQ cannot 100% ensure type-safety
- Support for ARRAY types. Oracle, Postgres, HSQLDB and H2 ARRAY
  types are now supported natively as regular <T> bindings in
  jOOQ's Field<T>
- Support for dialect-specific data types. CHAR, VARCHAR, CLOB
  are no longer treated equally as java.lang.String. Their
  type heritage is also generated
- More sequence support
- Lots and lots of bug fixes
