/**
 * An unexpected result was encountered after executing a {@link Query}. This
 * exception indicates wrong usage of jOOQ's various fetch methods, or an
 * integrity problem in your data.
 * <p>
 * This is typically the case in the following situations:
 * <ul>
 * <li>When you call methods such as {@link ResultQuery#fetchOne()} and the
 * database returns more than one record.</li>
 * <li>When you call methods such as
 * {@link ResultQuery#fetchMap(org.jooq.Field)} and the database returns several
 * records per key.</li>
 * <li>When you refresh a {@link TableRecord} using
 * {@link UpdatableRecord#refresh()}, and the record does not exist anymore in
 * the database.</li>
 * </ul>
