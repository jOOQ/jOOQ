What's jOOQ
===========

jOOQ stands for Java Object Oriented Querying. It combines these essential features:

  * Code Generation:
    jOOQ generates a simple Java representation of your database schema. Every table, view, stored procedure, enum, UDT is a class.

  * Active records:
    jOOQ implements an easy-to-use active record pattern. It is **not** an OR-mapper, but provides a 1:1 mapping between tables/views and classes. Between columns and members.

  * Typesafe SQL:
    jOOQ allows for writing compile-time typesafe querying using its built-in DSL.

  * SQL standard:
    jOOQ supports all standard SQL language features including the more complex `UNION`'s, nested `SELECT`s, joins, aliasing.

  * Vendor-specific feature support:
    jOOQ encourages the use of vendor-specific extensions such as stored procedures, UDT's and ARRAY's, recursive queries, and many more.
