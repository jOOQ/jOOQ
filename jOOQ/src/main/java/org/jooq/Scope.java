/**
 * Scope implementations provide access to a variety of objects that are
 * available from a given scope.
 * <p>
 * The scope of the various objects contained in this type (e.g.
 * {@link #configuration()}, {@link #settings()}, etc.) are implementation
 * dependent and will be specified by the concrete subtype of
 * <code>Scope</code>. Examples of such scope types are:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link ExecuteContext}: A scope that covers a single execution of a
 * {@link Query}</li>
 * <li>{@link Context}: A scope that covers a single traversal of a
 * {@link QueryPart} expression tree to produce a SQL string and / or a list of
 * bind variables.</li>
 * <li>{@link VisitContext}: A scope that that covers a single traversal of a
 * {@link QueryPart} expression tree (just like {@link Context}), in the
 * presence of at least one {@link VisitListener}.</li>
 * <li>{@link RecordContext}: A scope that covers a single record operation,
 * such as {@link UpdatableRecord#store()}.</li>
 * <li>{@link TransactionContext}: A scope that covers the execution (or
 * nesting) of a single transaction.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * One of <code>Scope</code>'s most interesting features for client code
 * implementing any SPI is the {@link #data()} map, which provides access to a
 * {@link Map} where client code can register user-defined values for the entire
 * lifetime of a scope. For instance, in an {@link ExecuteListener}
 * implementation that measures time for fetching data, it is perfectly possible
 * to store timestamps in that map:
 * <p>
 * <code><pre>
 * class FetchTimeMeasuringListener extends DefaultExecuteListener {
 *     &#64;Override
 *     public void fetchStart(ExecuteContext ctx) {
 *
 *         // Put any arbitrary object in this map:
 *         ctx.data("org.jooq.example.fetch-start-time", System.nanoTime());
 *     }
 *
 *     &#64;Override
 *     public void fetchEnd(ExecuteContext ctx) {
 *
 *         // Retrieve that object again in a later step:
 *         Long startTime = (Long) ctx.data("org.jooq.example.fetch-start-time");
 *         System.out.println("Time taken: " + (System.nanoTime() - startTime) / 1000 / 1000.0 + " ms");
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre></code>
