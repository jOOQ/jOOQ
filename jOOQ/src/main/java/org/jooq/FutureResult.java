 * Fetch results asynchronously.

 * especially useful when
 * <ul>
 * <li>You want to load heavy data in the background, for instance when the user
 * logs in and accesses a pre-calculated dashboard screen, before they access
 * the heavy data.</li>
 * <li>You want to parallelise several independent OLAP queries before merging
 * all data into a single report</li>
 * <li>...</li>
