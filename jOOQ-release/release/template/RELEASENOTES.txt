Version 2.2.3 - July 1, 2012
=================================================================

This is a minor patch release, fixing some issues

Bug fixes
---------
#1109 - Standalone TABLE or VARRAY types are not correctly
        initialised before referencing tables load them
#1360 - jOOR issue 12: "Don't reset the accessible flag to false,
        if setting it to true is required, to avoid race
        conditions in concurrency contexts"
#1394 - NullPointerException when omitting <generate/> element in
        code generation configuration
#1403 - Documentation bug: ctx.statement() can be replaced in
        executeStart(). This is not documented
#1406 - Compilation errors in generated source code when Postgres
        stored procedure parameter is called "NAME"
#1407 - Compilation errors in generated source code when Postgres
        data-type is "any" (with quotes!)
#1441 - Performance issue with AbstractDataType.convert(Object).
        Avoid conversions when they're obviously unneeded
#1449 - Generate some meaningful Javadoc into the generated
        [schema-name]Factory classes
#1454 - Add line breaks to generated Javadoc where appropriate
#1465 - Custom generator strategy's printImplements() is called
        with Mode == RECORD for tables
#1478 - Caching SQLDialect in AbstractDatabase heavily improves
        code generation performance
#1483 - Inefficient cloning of default settings using JAXB
        unmarshalling leads to non-negligible overall overhead.
        Use serialisation instead (short of a useful XJC clone
        plugin)
#1490 - Compilation error when a SQL Server stored procedure has
        a parameter named "value"
#1493 - Bad syntax for SELECT /*+hint*/ DISTINCT ... in Oracle
#1515 - Splitting of large NOT IN conditions is wrong. The parts
        should be connected with AND, not with OR

Version 2.2.2 - April 22, 2012
=================================================================

This is a minor patch release, fixing some issues

        stored procedures
#1329 - NullPointerException when passing null to
        timestampDiff(Field, Field)

Version 2.2.1 - April 12, 2012
=================================================================

This is a minor patch release, fixing some issues related to the
code generation of the new CUBRID integration as well as other,
minor issues. Upgrade if you're using CUBRID

Bug fixes
---------
#1287 - Remove oracle.sql dependency also from OSGi information
        in pom.xml
#1288 - SQL syntax errors from sequences when using RenderMapping
        with defaultSchema
#1289 - DefaultBindContext logs as Util.class
#1297 - Compilation error in CUBRID generated artefacts
        referencing OBJECT types
#1298 - Avoid source code generation errors when generating code
        for unknown, dialect-specific data types

Version 2.2.0 - April 09, 2012
=================================================================

Finally, jOOQ has added support for another database, and a very
promising one, that is. http://www.cubrid.org is a surprisingly
original mixture of a relational and object-oriented database
where tables and classes are synonyms, so are records and
instances. The CUBRID database has a high level of compatibility
with MySQL and is aimed at MySQL users wanting more performance
for their web applications. For details, see the slides here:

http://www.slideshare.net/cubrid/growing-in-the-wild-the-story-by-cubrid-database-developers

jOOQ is proud to have become a CUBRID partner, looking forward
to further cooperation with CUBRID in the near future.

Apart from that, jOOQ now fully supports SQL standard INTERVAL
data types. With JDBC and JPA lacking official support for this,
jOOQ aims for becoming the tool of choice for vendor-specific
date time arithmetic. True INTERVAL data type support is given in
HSQLDB, Ingres, Oracle, Postgres databases. Besides that, CUBRID
and MySQL support INTERVAL data type arguments in functions. In
other dialects, jOOQ simulates DATEADD(), TIMESTAMPADD(),
DATEDIFF(), TIMESTAMPDIFF().

For jOOQ's OLAP friends, there is now also support for the Oracle
LISTAGG function (LIST() in Sybase, XMLAGG() in DB2, STRING_AGG()
in Postgres, GROUP_CONCAT() in CUBRID, H2, HSQLDB, MySQL).
LISTAGG is an "ordered aggregate function", meaning that the
aggregation is done using a specific ordering. Keep an eye out
for more such function support in future versions.

        values

API changes (backwards-compatible)
----------------------------------
#1262 - Pull up OracleFactory.prior() and other CONNECT BY
        related methods to Factory

Bug fixes
---------
#1241 - Wrong variable binding when comparing CHAR columns in
        Derby and DB2 without explicit casting to VARCHAR
#1244 - Cannot override class name in GeneratorStrategy in
        Mode.POJO
#1248 - Setting both <records>false</records> and
        <relations>true</relations> leads to compilation errors
#1256 - Fixed code generation issue with H2 user defined
        functions returning VARCHAR
#1263 - Pass fetchsizes <= 0 to the JDBC driver (for vendor-
        specific MySQL compatibility)
#1270 - Most databases allow for multiple identical foreign keys.
        This leads to compilation errors in generated source code

Version 2.1.0 - March 18, 2012
=================================================================

With this version, jOOQ attempts to follow versioning rules
imposed by semantic versioning: http://semver.org/
There will be 1 minor release per month, and a couple of patch
releases per year, depending on popular demand

The main improvements for this release include

- The possibility of providing jOOQ with a custom type mapping.
  You can now define your own Converter types that are used by
  jOOQ to map a database's SQLDataTypes to your custom types.
  This is particularly useful for Java's enums. Read more about
  custom converters in the manual:
  http://www.jooq.org/manual/ADVANCED/CustomTypes/

- There are a lot of new runtime configuration options to control
  the SQL style of SQL rendered by jOOQ. You can now specify
  whether table/column names should be quoted / capitalised /
  lower-cased, whether SQL keywords should be capitalised or not,
  etc...

- The handling of NULL has been improved in favour of using jOOQ
  as a SQL builder library (e.g. along with Spring for execution)
  NULL is no longer inlined, but bound as a variable.

- jOOQ now supports simulation of the relational division
  operation using an intuitive syntax. Read more about the
  relational division here:
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_algebra#Division

#625  - Remove dependency from generated Routines to the
        generator's SQLDialect
#1128 - NULL is inlined in INSERT statement instead of binding it
        as a variable. This can cause issues when using jOOQ with

        that are excluded from code generation

Version 2.0.5 - February 26, 2012
=================================================================

This release finally introduced basic runtime configuration
features for the jOOQ Factory. This configuration now includes:

- Execute listener and SQL tracing support. jOOQ allows you to
  hook your own listeners into jOOQ's query execution engine to
  be notified of all sorts of events
- The existing SchemaMapping features. They are now part of the
  runtime configuration
- StatementType settings. Specify whether a Factory should
  execute java.sql.PreparedStatements (with bind variables) or
  static java.sql.Statements with inlined variables.

The runtime configuration is documented here:

http://www.jooq.org/manual/JOOQ/Factory/

The listener and tracing support has been requested by
Christopher Deckers, a new jOOQ user who has had the courtesy to
contribute the new jOOQ Console, which is documented here:

http://www.jooq.org/manual/ADVANCED/ExecuteListener/

Apart from that, another long-requested feature is now fully
implemented: The GeneratorStrategy, allowing for custom naming
strategies in generated source code. This will allow for
generating custom table / record class name prefixes / suffixes,
as well as overriding the default behaviour for rendering UPPER,
lower and CamelCase artefacts. See the manual for details:

http://www.jooq.org/manual/META/Configuration/

Features and improvements
-------------------------
#93   - Add Field.equalIgnoreCase(), Field.notEqualIgnoreCase()
#408  - Add class prefixes, suffixes and other options to the
        code generator
#492  - Add runtime configuration
#1107 - Let Field.contains() support the Postgres ARRAY @> ARRAY
        operator
#1140 - Add ResultQuery.fetchResultSet() to return the underlying
        JDBC result set
#1143 - Add Result.isNotEmpty() for convenience
#1145 - Add runtime configuration to specify whether jOOQ should
        execute java.sql.PreparedStatement (with bind variables)
        or a java.sql.Statement (with inlined parameters)
#1146 - Add Query.getSQL(boolean) to indicate that bind values
        should be inlined (as a convenience for
        Factory.renderInlined(QueryPart))
#1148 - Add Cursor.resultSet() to expose the underlying ResultSet
#1149 - Allow for optional
        "http://www.jooq.org/xsd/jooq-codegen-2.0.4.xsd"
        namespace in jooq-codegen configuration
#1152 - Add <E extends java.lang.Enum<E> & org.jooq.EnumType>
        E MySQLFactory.enumType(Class<E>, int) for enum reverse
        lookups of MySQL-specific enums
#1159 - Support matching numbers with LIKE, e.g. ID LIKE '%33%'
#1160 - Implement Field.contains(), .startsWith(), .endsWith()
        for numeric values, too
#1161 - Use reflection to remove compile-time dependency on
        ojdbc for creating ARRAYs
#1162 - Integrate jOOR into jOOQ for simpler reflection
#1164 - Distinguish between Definition.getInputName(),
        .getOutputName()
#1165 - Add constraint name to generated javadoc
#1167 - Trivial issue with org.jooq.Factory.exists Javadoc -
        GitHub issue #10
#1169 - Add Configuration.setData(), getData() to convey custom
        data in a configuration's lifecycle
#1172 - Add runtime configuration to deactivate JooqLogger
#1177 - Add jOOQ-Console module to jOOQ
#1184 - Add DataType.isArray()

API changes (backwards-compatible)
----------------------------------
#1142 - Rename Result.exportXML() to Result.intoXML() to stay
        more consistent
#1151 - Deprecate SchemaMapping in favour of new runtime
        configuration

Bug fixes
---------
#978  - Schema.getTables() and similar methods return empty lists
        when Schema is mapped with SchemaMapping
#1153 - Bad inlining of booleans in Sybase ASE / DB2 / Oracle
        SQL Server / SQLite
#1154 - Bad inlining of byte[] in most dialects
#1155 - byte[] are erroneously converted to String when using
        Record.intoArray()
#1156 - Bad inlining of DATE / TIME / TIMESTAMP data types in
        Ingres (and other dialects, when the setting differs from
        the default)
#1166 - Some generated Javadoc uses naming strategy or plain
        output name, instead of qualified output name
#1168 - Oracle packages are generated as static, instead of
        static final
#1175 - Factory.use() seems to render SQL with the Schema name
        still present
#1179 - Oracle-generated ArrayRecords need a reference to
        org.jooq.Schema to read TABLE of OBJECT from stored
        procedures

Test cases
----------
#1147 - Add integration tests for executing SQL generated using
        Factory.renderInlined()

Version 2.0.4 - February 12, 2012
=================================================================

This release introduced many improvements to source code
generation. These improvements include:

- Maven and standalone code generation now use the same XML
  configuration, which is read by jOOQ-codegen using JAXB. This
  allows for more complex configuration elements in the future
- jOOQ-codegen can now handle multi-schema databases and generate
  code for tables referencing tables from other schemata. This
  is integration tested against the SQL Server AdventureWorks
  database
- jOOQ now allows to generate simple POJOs in addition to Records
  and to annotate both POJOs and Records with JPA annotations
  such as @Entity, @Table, @Id, @Column, @UniqueConstraint, etc.

You can migrate your existing .properties configuration by running
> org.jooq.util.GenerationTool /your.properties migrate

Besides that, there is a lot of ongoing work to improve the
integration of Oracle's TABLE and VARRAY types.

        unnests "COLUMN_VALUE"
#1117 - NullPointerException when passing an ArrayRecord
        containing a null array to a stored function in Oracle
#1125 - Postgres needs casting for date time data types in
        queries like SELECT ? FROM DUAL
#1131 - DB2: [Noauthorized routine named "LIKE" of type
        "FUNCTION" having compatible arguments was found] when
        using Field.like(concat(x, y))
#1133 - Compilation errors in generated source code if the same
        constraint name exists in several schemata
#1134 - NullPointerException in code generation when a foreign
        key constraint references a table from another schema
        that is not being generated

        code, each.

Version 2.0.3 - January 29, 2012
=================================================================

This release focuses on increased compatibility between various
SQL dialect integrations as far as ARRAY and JOIN support is
concerned:

- ARRAY types are only available in H2, HSQLDB, Oracle, Postgres.
  Nevertheless, they can be somewhat simulated in other dialects
  using nested selects with UNION ALL. Increased compatibility
  leads to a nicer API, where ARRAYs are used along with ALL/ANY
  quantifiers, for instance.

- JOIN syntaxes can be quite powerful in SQL. Apart from
  simulating NATURAL JOIN, JOIN USING clauses, as well as a
  synthetic "KEY JOIN" syntax, jOOQ now also supports nesting
  JOIN expressions to create more complex table sources. See a
  recent blog post on the subject here:

http://lukaseder.wordpress.com/2012/01/15/lets-revise-the-sql-from-clause/

Features and improvements
-------------------------
#578  - Add KEY JOIN syntax to simulate joining using generated
        foreign keys
#577  - Simulate NATURAL JOIN syntax, where this is unavailable
#582  - Simulate JOIN USING syntax, where this is unavailable
#671  - Allow for nesting JOIN clauses
#676  - Add Table.join() methods to create more flexible table
        sources
#993  - Add Field.equalAny(T[]), .equalAny(Field<T[]>) methods
#1048 - Simulate <op> <quantifier> (array) syntax for dialects
        that do not support arrays
#1051 - Add Factory.execute(String, Object...) as a convenience
        method for Factory.query(...).execute()
#1055 - Simulate Factory.table(Object[]) and table(List<?>) using
        UNION ALL in dialects that do not support arrays
#1060 - Improve debug logging of H2 arrays. The syntax is not
        ARRAY[1, 2], but (1, 2)
#1065 - Add OracleFactory.sysContext(String, String) to support
        Oracle's SYS_CONTEXT function
#1069 - Add support for INSERT INTO table(field1, field2, ...)
        SELECT syntax - as opposed to the existing INSERT INTO
        table SELECT
#1072 - Add support for LIKE .. ESCAPE .. syntax
#1074 - Add Field.notBetween(T, T) for convenience
#1080 - Add support for JDBC's Statement.setFetchSize() in
        ResultQuery.fetchLazy()
#1082 - Add some more DEBUG logging in AbstractResultQuery

API changes (backwards-compatible)
----------------------------------
#1059 - Change SelectFromStep.from(Collection<TableLike<?>>) to
        from(Collection<? extends TableLike<?>>)

API changes (backwards-incompatible)
------------------------------------
#1087 - Change the NTILE function to return Field<Integer>
        instead of Field<BigDecimal>

Bug fixes
---------
#1071 - Make Sequence Serializable
#1081 - Derby error in NULL handling when simulating unnested
        arrays that contain NULL values
#1084 - Bind index mismatch in val(null).equal(null) and in
        val(null).notEqual(null)
#1091 - Add missing @Support annotations on Table.crossJoin()
        methods

Test cases
----------
#1026 - Add integration tests for NTILE window function and
        document compatibility
#1073 - Add integration tests for NOT IN queries holding NULL
        arguments

Version 2.0.2 - January 8, 2012
=================================================================

This is a maintenance release for jOOQ 2.0. The main improvements
include

- The whole jOOQ API is now annotated with a new org.jooq.Support
  annotation to help you assess whether a certain SQL clause is
  available in your database or not. This is particularly useful
  when your application should support several databases at once
  (e.g. MySQL, Postgres, Oracle)
- The Oracle PIVOT clause is now formally supported for advanced
  statistical queries in Oracle. This clause will be simulated in
  other dialects in the future.
- The DATE data type can be mapped to TIMESTAMP. This important
  when you query a legacy Oracle database, where DATE columns
  can also contain time information
- Several convenience methods have been added for more fluent
  syntax, when using plain SQL result queries, subqueries as
  tables, or when unnesting arrays in ANY() and ALL() quantifiers

Further type mapping support is still experimental. An official
cooperation with MinuteProject for source code generation is
being analysed. With MinuteProject, many source code generation
issues could be addressed centrally, as MinuteProject specialises
in source code generation:

Version 2.0.1 - December 23, 2011
=================================================================

This is a maintenance release for jOOQ 2.0. The main improvements
include

- Better integration for using jOOQ with Spring Data. This
  includes support for named parameters, as well as allowing to
  change bind values on previously constructed Query objects
- The MERGE statement has been enhanced for better integration
  with Oracle.
- jOOQ is now ready to use with Scala / Groovy

For more information about using jOOQ with Scala, see this blog
post:
http://lukaseder.wordpress.com/2011/12/11/the-ultimate-sql-dsl-jooq-in-scala/

There is now also experimental support for a custom type mapping.
This mapping allows to rewrite data types at code generation time
as well as to specify custom enum data types (e.g. boolean Y/N).
Not all integration tests run smoothly for custom data types,
hence, this feature is not yet fully supported.

Features and improvements
-------------------------
#691  - Add support for Oracle CURSOR REF IN / INOUT parameters
#677  - Add type-mapping configuration, enforcing types for
        columns
#947  - Add custom type mapping support (experimental)
#968  - Allow for custom enum types, configured in the code
        generator (experimental)
#974  - Add Schema.getTable(String), getSequence(String),
        getUDT(String) for better runtime Schema meta-navigation
#975  - Add Sequence.getName(), getSchema(), getDataType()
#980  - Add support for named parameters, to better interact with
        Spring
#991  - Add Query.bind(String, Object) and bind(int, Object) to
        easily modify existing bind values
#992  - Document thrown DataTypeException in Convert methods
#998  - Enhance MERGE statement for Oracle extensions:
        WHEN MATCHED THEN UPDATE .. WHERE .. DELETE WHERE ..
        WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN INSERT .. WHERE ..
#1000 - Add support for MySQL's INSERT INTO .. SET .. syntax in
        MERGE statement's WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN INSERT clause

API changes (backwards-compatible)
----------------------------------
#981  - Cannot insertInto(table("my_table")), as plain SQL tables
        return Table<Record>, not Table<TableRecord>. Relax
        bound on R
#988  - Change Factory.field(String) to return Field<Object>
        instead of Field<?>
#999  - Make MERGE's WHEN MATCHED .. and WHEN NOT MATCHED ..
        clauses optional
#1001 - Identity.getField() should return TableField<R, T>
        instead of Field<T>
#1006 - Add Factory.value(...) as a synonym for Factory.val(...)
        for increased Scala / Groovy compatibility

Bug fixes
---------
#973  - EnumType renders name() instead of getLiteral() in
        formatXXX() methods
#977  - EnumType renders name() instead of getLiteral() in
        Convert.convert() method
#979  - Record.from() sets all changed flags to true. That's not
        necessarily correct in the event of storing the record
        back to the DB
#985  - AbstractRecord.equals() does not correctly compare
        arrays. Compare them using Arrays.asList()
#986  - Postgres / DB2 / Sybase ASE foreign-key namespace is
        unique-per-table. jOOQ forces all foreign keys from all
        tables into the same namespace
#990  - Problems when encoding arbitrary byte[] as String(byte[])
        in inlined SQL. This can cause issues when DEBUG-level
        logging is activated
#995  - Routines don't respect SchemaMapping - Github issue #8
#1002 - TableRecord.storeUsing() doesn't update IDENTITY column
        values, if the column is not part of the main unique key
#1003 - Sybase / SQL Server / MySQL / Ingres / H2 / Derby's
        INSERT .. RETURNING simulation returns null if a table
        has an IDENTITY column, but no primary/unique key
#1005 - The INSERT INTO .. VALUES .. syntax may cause type-safety
        issues in some databases. VALUES should be converted
        before binding

Test cases
----------
#984  - Detach IDENTITY column tests from UNIQUE KEY tests,
        create a dedicated test suite instead

Version 2.0.0 - November 25, 2011
=================================================================
This release is a fresh start in many areas of jOOQ, adressing
issues that have been requested by users for a long time. These
release notes docment the most important changes, a detailed
upgrade guide, as well as the detailed list of improvements.

Most important changes
----------------------
- The API became more static. This applies to many Factory
  methods, such as val(), literal(), as well as to many Field
  methods that have been moved over to the Factory. For example,
  when before, you wrote this using "postfix function notation":

    <pre>NAME.replace(" ", "_").trim()</pre>

  you will now write (just as in SQL):

    <pre>trim(replace(NAME, " ", "_"))</pre>

  Using static imports of Factory.*, jOOQ makes SQL look even
  more like SQL. The current "postfix notation" is maintained for
  backwards compatibility.
- By default, jooq-codegen will now generate a "dynamic" meta
  model as opposed to the existing static one. Generated tables
  covariantly override the as(String) aliasing method, leading
  to a much more convenient aliasing style. When before, you
  wrote:

<pre>
Table<TRecord> parent = T.as("parent");
Table<TRecord> child  = T.as("child");
Condition join =
  parent.getField("ID").equal(child.getField("PARENT_ID"))
</pre>

  You can now write:

<pre>
T parent = T.as("parent");
T child  = T.as("child");
Condition join = parent.ID.equal(child.PARENT_ID)
</pre>

  Of course, the existing notation still works

- Exceptions are no longer checked. When previously, the DB's
  SQLException was propagated to client code, there is now an
  unchecked DataAccessException hierarchy, similar to that of
  Spring. This will eventually give way to a standardised error
  handling abstraction, in future developments.
- Window functions are now constructed from their underlying
  aggregate functions just like in SQL. For example:

<pre>
sum(AMOUNT)
sum(AMOUNT).over().partitionBy(ACCOUNT)
</pre>

  This makes for a more concise API, especially when considering
  future extensions, such as Oracle's KEEP (DENSE_RANK FIRST...)
  syntax.
- More type safety has been introduced regarding various places
  where generic <R extends Record> and <T> types are involved.
  This is especially true for INSERT / UPDATE / DELETE statements
- Sequences now also have a <T> type
- Unsigned number types are now supported in those databases that
  use them. Unsigned numbers are implemented in jOOU, a spin-off
  open source project. For convenience, this library is
  "internalised" into jOOQ, to avoid adding a dependency

http://code.google.com/p/joou/

Upgrade instructions:
---------------------
Various of the above changes are incompatible with jOOQ 1.x. In
order to upgrade, please be aware of the following pitfalls:

- The schema needs to be re-generated.
- Much of the post-fix function notation is replaced by static
  methods in the Factory. Today's org.jooq.Field API is
  maintained in jOOQ 2.0, for backwards compatibility. It will
  be removed, eventually, though. Expect some incompatible
  changes, where window functions are involved
- Some Factory instance methods (such as val(), literal()) are
  now static. They are compatible, but may cause compiler
  warnings.
- The meta model is now an instance model by default. If you
  prefer the static meta model, you can configure this in your
  jooq-codegen configuration.
- The additional typesafety involving <R> and <T> types may cause
  compiler warnings and errors.
- SQLException is no longer part of the API. This can cause
  compiler issues, in particular when extending jOOQ
- Some utility classes have moved to org.jooq.tools

Should these incompatibilities be too significant for your
project, you can still stay on the 1.x branch, which will be
maintained for a while. Be aware that upgrading might be more
difficult, later, though.

Version 1.6.9 - November 7, 2011
=================================================================
This is a maintenance release for the 1.x branch. Developments
on this branch will stop after version 1.6.9. Only important bug
fixes are merged to this branch. Developments for release 2.0
have started.

The most important functionality in release 1.6.9 is the newly
added support for JDBC batch operations. You can now batch
execute several queries.

See the official blog for more information:
http://lukaseder.wordpress.com/2011/10/25/jdbc-batch-operations-with-jooq/

Features and improvements
-------------------------
#621 - Add support for JDBC batch operations
#794 - Add support for ORDER BY [int value] in order to reference
       a column index for sorting
#882 - Optimise Field.isTrue() and isFalse(). Take Field's data
       type into consideration.
#885 - Add support for INSERT INTO .. VALUES (..) syntax,
       omitting explicit field declarations
#887 - Add <E> List<E> Cursor.fetchInto(Class<E>)

Bug fixes
---------
#748 - H2 regression in 1.3.158 regarding stored functions, which
       return a ResultSet (this was fixed in H2)
#859 - Derby casting of numeric types to BOOLEAN doesn't work
#886 - Regression in date extract function when used in a
       subselect
#888 - Derby casting of VARCHAR to FLOAT (and similar) doesn't
       work

Version 1.6.8 - October 22, 2011
=================================================================
The main improvement of this release is the re-design of the
stored procedure / function API. With 12 supported RDBMS, which
all have their own idea about what is a stored procedure and what
is a stored function, it has proven to be a better design, to
unite them in one single type: org.jooq.Routine. A routine can
have a return value as well as OUT parameters. It can be embedded
in SQL and used as a field or a table.

This means, you will need to re-generate your database schema,
when upgrading to jOOQ 1.6.8. After re-generation, you'll need to
fix your client code. These are the package changes:

- [generated.package].procedures > [generated.package].routines
- [generated.package].functions  > [generated.package].routines
- [generated.package].Procedures > [generated.package].Routines
- [generated.package].Functions  > [generated.package].Routines

Oracle generated packages are not re-located. With these
improvements, using stored procedures and functions becomes even
more reliable, especially when cursor types are involved. Read
more about the rationale behind this change:

http://lukaseder.wordpress.com/2011/10/17/what-are-procedures-and-functions-after-all/

Apart from that, important improvements have been made in the
area of plain SQL tables. Also, consider a demo integration of
jOOQ with Google Cloud SQL:

Version 1.6.7 - September 25, 2011
=================================================================

This release coincides with the launch of the new website at
http://www.jooq.org. Hence, it ships with little additions to the
deliverable itself.

Apart from new convenience methods, the main addition is a Maven
plugin for jooq-codegen contributed by Sander Plas.

Features and improvements
-------------------------
#797 - Create Maven plugin for source code generation
#825 - Add List<Result<Record>> Factory.fetchMany(String) to
       allow for fetching several result sets from stored
       procedures, such as Sybase ASE's "sp_help"
#838 - Implement MetaDataFieldProvider.toString()
#841 - Add <T> List<T> Result.getValues(Field<?>, Class<T>)
#842 - Add Query.getBindValues() method to allow for extracting
       bind values in the correct order
#843 - Add Factory.fetch(ResultSet) to transform a JDBC ResultSet
       into a jOOQ Result

API changes (backwards-compatible)
----------------------------------
#837 - Avoid final keyword on Object methods, such as .equals(),
       .hashCode(), etc

Bug fixes
---------
#836 - Bad syntax when selecting from aliased plain SQL tables
#839 - Boolean conversion in getValueAsBoolean() should trim
       String values first
#840 - Numeric conversions in getValueAsXXX() should trim String
       values first
#844 - NullPointerException when selecting a column from a Result,
       that does not exist

Version 1.6.6 - September 11, 2011
=================================================================

Finally, support for another RDBMS has been added. Sybase's other
important product Sybase Adaptive Server Enterprise (or simply
Sybase ASE) is now officially supported by jOOQ

Apart from this, there had been important improvements with the
recently added INSERT .. RETURNING clause, as well as some fixes
related to DECIMAL / NUMERIC data types

Features and improvements
-------------------------
#796 - Complete missing public org.jooq.impl Javadoc
#800 - Add support for Sybase Adaptive Server Enterprise
#808 - Add support for INSERT .. RETURNING for Ingres
#809 - Add support for INSERT .. RETURNING for Sybase SQL
       Anywhere using SELECT @@identity
#810 - Add support for INSERT .. RETURNING for SQLite using
       last_inserted_rowid()
#813 - Add DSL support for INSERT .. RETURNING
#814 - Change TableRecord to reload its trigger-initialised main
       key in Oracle and other RDBMS that don't support IDENTITY
       columns
#818 - Add SQLiteFactory.rowid()
#819 - Support SQLite AUTOINCREMENT columns as IDENTITY
#820 - Add Factory.fetchOne(String) for executing plain SQL
       queries that return single records
#826 - Allow for returning several records in the INSERT ..
       RETURNING clause. This now works for DB2, HSQLDB, MySQL,
       and Postgres
#827 - Support Sybase SQL Anywhere's TOP n START AT m clause
       instead of simulating it with nested SELECT's

API changes (previous API now deprecated)
-----------------------------------------
#817 - Deprecate Factory.lastID(Identity)

Bug fixes
---------
#815 - SQL Server fetching of IDENTITY value is broken
#821 - Optimise ResultQuery.fetchAny() executing fetchLazy()
       internally, and only fetching one record from the cursor
#822 - Let Constant cast to more precise NUMERIC/DECIMAL types
       in those RDBMS where casting is necessary
#823 - Cannot bind SQLite BigDecimal, BigInteger types - bind
       them as String instead
#824 - BigInteger values cannot be bound in DB2, Derby
#828 - Document inefficient implementation for GREATEST and LEAST
       in some RDBMS

Version 1.6.5 - August 28, 2011
=================================================================

This release finally adds a loader for CSV data to jOOQ. You can
now load CSV data using a simple fluent API, configuring error
handling, duplicate behaviour and transaction handling, as well
as various CSV parameters.

This release also changes the way generated keys are retrieved
after INSERT's. Instead of (potentially inconsistently) running
SELECT MAX(pk) immediately after the INSERT, Postgres' INSERT..
RETURNING clause is used (or simulated), in a single statement.

Features and improvements
-------------------------
#784 - Add Result.exportXML() to retrieve a DOM document similar
       to that of .formatXML()
#792 - Add support for loading of CSV data into tables
#795 - Add <T> List<T> fetch(int, Class<T>) and
       fetch(String, Class<T>) convenience methods
#803 - Add support for INSERT .. RETURNING or simulate it where
       not available
#805 - Add <T> T[] fetchArray(int, Class<T>) and
       fetchArray(String, Class<T>) convenience methods
#806 - Add <T> T fetchOne(int, Class<T>) and
       fetchOne(String, Class<T>) convenience methods

Bug fixes
---------
#798 - Oracle IN (...) clause with more than 1000 arguments does
       not work
#802 - Use "INSERT .. RETURNING" instead of "SELECT MAX(pk)"
       to retrieve the primary key of a new record

Version 1.6.4 - August 07, 2011
=================================================================

This release ships with a couple of useful concepts inspired by
other frameworks. These are:

- selecting into custom POJO's. Results can be mapped to POJO's
  by convention or using JPA @Column annotations
- selecting into custom callbacks. This is already a wide-spread
  practice in Spring JdbcTemplates.
- selecting long-running queries asynchronously. This idea has
  been inspired by the Avaje Ebean framework

Apart from these changes and some bugfixes, the internal API has
been completely re-designed. The idea here is that query
rendering and variable binding are even faster (less String
objects), more extensible and more accurate. This is a pre-
requisite for many future developments with even more complex SQL
statements, such as for instance CTE's (Common Table Expressions)

Features and improvements
-------------------------
#137 - Add support for asynchronous query execution using
       FutureResult<R> ResultQuery.fetchLater() similar to
       Avaje Ebean
#198 - Add SELECT INTO functionality into POJO's using
       <T> T ResultQuery.fetchInto(Class<T>) similar to JPA
       CriteriaQuery
#728 - Add .fetchInto(RecordHandler<R>) to ResultQuery, Result,
       and Cursor to allow for callbacks similar to Spring's
       JdbcTemplate/Ollin Framework
#774 - Add more TRACE logging to .fetchLazy()
#777 - CURSOR: Add function alias: UNNEST for TABLE
#781 - Add E function (Euler number)
#782 - Add <T> T Record.getValue(..., Class<? extends T>) methods
       for convenient type conversion
#785 - Allow for storing TableRecord with a provided Field<?>[]
       indicating the primary key
#786 - Document thread-safety facts in Factory Javadoc
#788 - Add Key.getFieldsArray() convenience method
#793 - Add support for Oracle's SYS_CONNECT_BY_PATH function

API changes (backwards-incompatible)
------------------------------------
#758 - Change internal QueryPart rendering and binding API to use
       Configuration and Context as callback parameters. If you
       use CustomField or CustomCondition, please correct your
       implementations accordingly. Other parts of the API should
       not be affected
#778 - Purge deprecated API, deprecation prior to jOOQ 1.5.7
#790 - Purge deprecated generated code, deprecation prior to
       jOOQ 1.5.7

API changes (previous API now deprecated)
-----------------------------------------
#776 - Deprecate QueryPart.getSQL(), add Query.getSQL()
#789 - Deprecate Record constructors with Configuration
       parameter

Test cases
----------
#636 - Add integration tests for more advanced CONNECT BY
       example
#772 - Add integration tests for selecting cartesian products
       (several tables in FROM clause)

Bug fixes
---------
#730 - Sybase cannot bind null values in plain SQL
#759 - Omit the TOP 100 PERCENT clause in SQL Server ordered
       top-level queries
#767 - An empty Java package is generated for PL/SQL packages
       containing underscores
#771 - Some exotic literals are not properly escaped with quotes
       yet, e.g. UDT identifiers, VARRAY types, etc.
#775 - Automatic re-attaching after deserialisation does not work
       when used with .fetchLazy()
#787 - The UpdatableRecord's internal changed flags are not
       updated after INSERTs / UPDATEs

Version 1.6.3 - July 31, 2011
=================================================================

This is mainly a maintenance release with lots of bugfixes,
mostly around code generation, plain SQL tables, and data types.
Please note that generated source code may contain incompatible
changes due to #639 (see below for details)!

Apart from that, project CURSOR is advancing and it is now
possible to unnest arrays into tables. See this article for
details about where jOOQ is heading with project CURSOR:

       HSQLDB again, to prevent incompatibility issues
#744 - Ingres REAL and FLOAT4 types are generated as FLOAT/FLOAT8
       which maps to java.lang.Double, instead of java.lang.Float
#753 - Postgres error when binding array that contains null
       values
#755 - NullPointerException when converting an array containing
       a null value
#766 - Bad decoding of JDBC Types BIGINT (to BigInteger instead
       of Long) and REAL (to BigDecimal instead of Float) when

Version 1.6.2 - July 10, 2011
=================================================================

This release mainly introduces three new projects.

Project CURSOR where jOOQ finally supports various RDBMS's TABLE,
CURSOR, and REF CURSOR data types. This is especially useful when
those types are returned from stored procedures and functions.
Cursors are simply mapped to jOOQ Result<Record> types and can
thus be used like regular table results

Project EXPORT aims at exporting data from the database in
various serialisable formats, such as XML, CSV, HTML, Text, JSON.
This project will be continued in the future, to also
deserialise from (some of) these data streams. This will allow
for easy transport of jOOQ Result<?> types over the net.

Project CODEGEN has finally been started. Many improvements
suggested by jOOQ users will be implemented in the next releases.
In this release, important fixes have been made to prevent
compilation errors in generated artefacts.

Version 1.6.1 - June 19, 2011
=================================================================

In this release, the PORTABILITY project has been implemented.
Finally, the SQLDialect has been removed from most generated
artefacts (Schema, Table, Field, Sequence, etc). Also, the
constructing Factory is not referenced by its created QueryParts
anymore, unless this is really necessary (Query objects, UDT's,
ARRAY types). This leads to higher compatibility between schemata
of different databases, e.g. if users want to use an HSQLDB
development and Oracle productive database.

Unfortunately, this means that the way stored procedures are
called had to be changed. This is an API break that could not be
avoided. The pre-1.6.1 StoredObject.execute(Connection) method
is deprecated and will be removed in the future. It has been
replaced by StoredObject.execute(Configuration)

In addition to this project, many more window functions are now
supported, as well as the Oracle-specific CONNECT BY clause for
recursive queries.

Features
--------
#351 - Add support for Oracle ROWID data type

#633 - SchemaMapping is not applied to sequences
#634 - Sequences are not escaped in generated SQL

Version 1.6.0 - June 05, 2011
=================================================================

Apart from supporting various additional standard and non-
standard JOIN constructs, there is now also full support for the
SQL standard MERGE statement and MySQL's ON DUPLICATE KEY variant

This version ships with lots of new functionality. Finally, the
DSL-style API has been extended to CRUD operations (INSERT,
UPDATE, DELETE)! Also, support for the TRUNCATE TABLE statement
has been added.

The most important new features include the support for SQL:2003

Version 1.5.8 - April 29, 2011
=================================================================

Finally, jOOQ now supports two important new RDBMS:
SQL Server and Sybase!

Apart from this great enhancement, there is now also full support
for the non-SQL standard LIMIT clause, even in dialects where the
LIMIT clause is not supported natively (especially Oracle, but
also DB2, SQL Server and Sybase, which have limitations). jOOQ
simulates LIMITs by rendering nested selects filtering on ROWNUM
(Oracle) or on ROW_NUMBER() (DB2, SQL Server and Sybase).

Other interesting additions are an increasing support for native
mathematical functions. More function support will be added in
future versions.

Features
--------
#16  - Added support for SQL Server
#21  - Uniform implementation of the LIMIT clause. Implemented
       LIMIT clause simulation through analytic functions, where
       LIMIT is not supported natively
#97  - Added support for Sybase
#418 - Measure time of various steps in source code generation
#420 - Added support for proprietary SQL extensions "FOR UPDATE"
       and "FOR SHARE"
#431 - Added additional statistics to generation log files
#432 - Unified the various "standard" ANSI INFORMATION_SCHEMA
       implementations in the jooq-meta artefact
#436 - Added support for the modulo function
#438 - Added floor and ceil functions
#439 - Added support for mathematical functions (logarithms,
       exponentials, sqrt)
#447 - Enhanced Field.add() and Field.subtract() to work for date
       time fields, also


API changes
-----------
#428 - Created new Maven artefact jooq-meta to cleanly separate
       database meta-data navigation from code generation
#458 - Decreased DSL verbosity for arithmetic operations and for
       ordering

Bug fixes
---------
#417 - Restored warning when unknown column type is encountered
       in source code generation
#419 - Corrected misleading Select.fetchOne(...) Javadoc
#421 - Optimised AbstractRecord's memory consumption
#448 - Corrected some Javadoc @see links
#449 - Changed Field.concatenate() to accept Field<?> parameters
       to avoid generic varargs warnings

Version 1.5.7 - April 17, 2011
=================================================================

This is the first release built with support of Maven thanks to
the help of some jOOQ users!

The main new features in this release are the improved support
for serialisation/deserialisation of jOOQ objects through use of
the newly introduced "Attachable" interface.

If using log4j or the newly supported slf4j logging framework
in debug/trace mode, there is the possibility to log query
building/execution time statistics.

Apart from these new features, fixes were mainly done in the
fields of type casting, HSQLDB 2.1 upgrade support, stored
procedures with OUT, IN/OUT parameters. Please upgrade, if you
are using any of those features.

If you extend jOOQ as a base implementation for source code
generation, be aware of the fact, that the jOOQ-codegen is
currently undergoing major changes. Expect the code generation
API to stabilise again in one of the next releases.

Version 1.5.6 - March 31, 2011
=================================================================

This release consists mainly of code generation bug fixes and
minor API improvements and enhancements.

The most important improvement is ticket #90, by which lazy
fetching and iteration over data is now supported. jOOQ lets you
keep a reference to a Cursor that has an open JDBC ResultSet, to
fetch data from on-the-fly.

A few major code generation bugs were reported where the
generated code may cause ambiguity due to an inconsistent API.
This means that you will have to re-generate your schema after
upgrading to version 1.5.6. Some of your code may not compile
anymore, after this upgrade.

Features
--------
#90  - Added possibility for lazy fetching of data
#208 - Added convenience methods for direct invocation of
       sequences' currval() and nextval() attributes
#212 - Created one factory per dialect for better separation of
       dialect-specific support
#213 - Generate a factory for each schema
#251 - Opened up base implementations for Field<?> and Condition
       to allow for custom implementations by client code
#274 - Integrate H2 ARRAY types with stored procedures
#292 - Documented usage of log4j and java.util.logging
#306 - Added support for the NULLIF function
#319 - Added Field.between(Field<T>, Field<T>) method
#320 - Added trace logging for variable binding and SQL
       generation methods

#342 - Improved generated referential code by using fetch() and
       fetchOne() API
#356 - Let UpdatableRecord.store() and delete() return an int
       to indicate whether the record was actually modified

API changes
-----------
#233 - Allow for joining TableLike instead of Table
#337 - Added generic type <R extends TableRecord<R>> to
       InsertSelectQuery

       may lead to compile-time ambiguities (with javac)
#343 - Add more foreign key navigation method integration tests
#347 - Add explicit integration tests for schema artefacts
       excluded from code generation
#350 - Disambiguate navigation methods if several foreign keys
       reference the same entity

code generation. Only the Derby dialect is affected. Please
update immediately, if you are using jOOQ's Derby integration

Bugfixes
--------
#315 - Generated master data records are not sorted by PK
#316 - Derby code generation fatally broken

Version 1.5.5 - March 12, 2011

This version is released early as there are some important
bugfixes. Additional improvemetns include:

- Improved DSL related to conditions in HAVING and JOIN clauses
- Support for Oracle-style functions, such as NVL, NVL2, COALESCE
  DECODE, etc

Features
--------
#304 - Add support for Oracle NVL function
#305 - Add support for COALESCE function
#308 - Add support for Oracle NVL2 function

Version 1.5.4 - March 04, 2011
=================================================================

Feature #243 required a minor API change in the base classes of
generated source code. This means you have to re-generate all
your jOOQ artifacts in order to migrate to 1.5.4. The artifacts
themselves should be regenerated in a compatible way, such that
your client code should not be affected. If this is not the case,
please report a ticket here:

  https://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/jooq/newticket

Apart from the Derby RDMBS and some new data type support, there
have been many new convenience methods added all over the API.
For instance, if type-safety is not really a requirement, there
are lots of possibilities to use plain SQL directly in the DSL.
In that case, data can be accessed from Record, Results, not only
through Field<?>, but also through field names or indexes.

Check out the updated documentation (soon) here:

  https://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/jooq/wiki/Examples

- Support for the Derby RDBMS
- Support for casting. This allows for even greater flexibility
  in cases where jOOQ cannot 100% ensure type-safety
- Support for ARRAY types. Oracle, Postgres, HSQLDB and H2 ARRAY
  types are now supported natively as regular <T> bindings in
  jOOQ's Field<T>
- Support for dialect-specific data types. CHAR, VARCHAR, CLOB
  are no longer treated equally as java.lang.String. Their
  type heritage is also generated
- More sequence support
- Lots and lots of bug fixes
